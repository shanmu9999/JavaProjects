public class OOPSConcepts {
	
	// Class : Class is a non-primitive Data type.
	// A class will act like a blueprint or template that defines properties (attributes/data) and behavior (methods) of Java objects.
	
	// Object : object is an instance of the class. (New copy of the class.) . 
	// So whenever we want to access any data or method from one class to another class or within the same class, inside the main method, we can create an object and we can access whatever information that we want.
	
	// Method: a method is a block of code or collection of statements written together to complete a specific task.
	
	// Constructor: constructor is a special and default method created by Java every time we are going to create a new class. We are using this constructor to initialize the object.
	
	//static : first of all, static is an non-access modifier. It will change the behavior of Java elements in such a way that all the members defined with static keyword will belong to the class instead of belonging to the class object.
	// whenever we are going to create a static member inside the class, we can access that static member directly by using the class name without creating the object of the class.
	
	
	// Inheritance: inheritance is a Java mechanism that allows a new class to inherit or extend all the properties (data & methods) from parent class to child class without creating any object.
	// Extends keyword is used to implement the inheritance between two different classes.
	// Always child class can extend parent class. Vice-versa is not possible.
	// Types of Inheritance: multiple inheritance (not possible with normal classes) , multi-level inheritance, hierarchical inheritance.
	
	// Abstraction: abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation.
	// we can achieve abstraction in java by using abstract classes and interfaces.
	// We are using the abstract keyword before the method when there is no body. Eventually, the class will also become abstract.
	// Interface: interface is a collection of abstract methods. we can achieve 100% abstraction by using interfaces.
	// we are using the interface keyword to create an interface.
	//In Java 8 and later versions, we can create default and static methods inside the interface.
	//In java 9 and later versions, we can create private methods inside the interface.
	
	// Encapsulation: encapsulation is a concept of hiding the information. (Binding the data and methods together)
	// we can achieve encapsulation in java by using access modifiers. (private)
		
	// Polymorphism: Polymorphism means many forms. 
	// Polymorphism is a concept of having the same method to complete different tasks.
	// 2 types of polymorphism: compile time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
