	//ExceptionHandling : Handling the Exceptions in Java
	
		// Error vs Exception
		
		// Error :  It's an Issue occurs during runtime and it's not possible to handle it in the program. Example : StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError etc.
		// Exception : It's an Issue occurs during runtime and it's possible to handle it in the program. Example : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException etc.

		// What is Exception Handling?
		// We can control the exceptions in 2 ways.
		// 1. When there is an exception, we can supress the exception and continue the normal flow of the program.
		// 2. When there is no exception, we can create our own exceptions and fail the program.
		
		// Types of Exception Handling Techniques in Java
		//1. throws declaration ==> When we know the exception details before itself (compulsory we will get exception)
		//2. try-catch block ==> When we don't know the exception details before itself (we may or may not get exception)
		//3. throw an custom exception ==> When there is no exception, we can create our own exceptions and fail the program.
