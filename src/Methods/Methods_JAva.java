		//How to create a method in Java?
		
		//1. Identify the duplicate code in your program that is going to complete a specific task.
		//2. Separate the duplicate code from each and every program and create a block outside of the main method and store duplicate code inside that.
		//3. Update each and every method block with meaningful names that reflect what tasks we are trying to complete.
		//4. Add the data-type before each and every method based on the data that we are expecting at the end.
		//5. Call the method inside the main method to execute the code.
		
		//Different types of methods in Java.
		
		//1. Method without return type.
		//2. Method with return type.
		//3. Method with parameters.
		//4. Method without parameters.
		//5. Static method.
		//6. Constructor methods.
